# Java-Anagrams-Checker
A simple Java program to check if two strings are Anagram of each other or not.

## What are Anagrams? ü§î
The words that contains same alphabets which are same in number as well. The common example of Anagrams are "Race" and "Care".
These both words have same alphabets and same number of alphabets. "Care" contains exactly same alphabets as "Race" and number of
each character of alphabets are same as well.

## Running the Program üíª
The program can be run if the Java 8+ has been installed and configured. Here configured means that the path variaable has been
set for java.
1. After cloning the Project, go to the project folder.
2. Type `javac AnagramsMatcher.java` this command will generate byte code to run by JVM.
3. Now type `java AnagramsMatcher` this command will run the generated byte code and result should be printed on command line.

## Working‚öôÔ∏è
So the program works in the 4 steps as described below:
1. First the length of both strings is checked if the length is not same then strings can never be anagrams.
2. Strings are converted to array of characters.
3. Both arrays of character are sorted using builtin Java functionality.
4. Then both arrays are compared to check if they are equal or not, if they are equal *true* would be returned else *false* would return.

## Time Complexity ‚åõ
Here the time is taken only on the sorting phase so we can say that the time complexity of the program is **O(n log n)**.
